This project was made by me for my 2nd Semester for Object Oriented Programming in Java.

This project is about automation in Youtube using Selenium where in it will get the first video based on title along with a comment section sentiment analysis 
done in a simple way. In sentiment analysis i used 2 strings denoting positive and negative words and will be checking the presence of these words in the comment and its respective 
sentiment will be displayed.

The neccesary dependencies are mentioned in pom.xml

You can just fork it and use it directly with your IntelliJ IDE. 

You also require a chromedrives, download it with respect to the current version of chrome available in your devicxe and make a small change in the pom.xml with the version 
and add it to the project structure.

MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE RESPECTIVE DEPENDENCIES


Thank You
